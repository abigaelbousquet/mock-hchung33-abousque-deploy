> **GETTING STARTED:** You should likely start with the `/mock` folder from your solution code for the mock gearup.

# Project Details

# Design Choices
- added newlines between command outputs in terminal for readability
- output label then NEWLINE actual output because it made our code the smoothest for displaying data results and error messages the same way, we justify this change as not affecting user interpretability because of the newline between command outputs (user should still be able to easily see what output corresponds to a given output label)
- changed REPLFunction to return a definitive string[][] rather than a string | string[][] because it made our code for displaying to history a lot cleaner and it is not hard to wrap a string message in a string[][]. our javadoc specifies this so user story 6 is still met
